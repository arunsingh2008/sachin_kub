Hello Happy Runners!

I’m excited to share that two of our very own—Pradeep and Subhra—are taking on an incredible challenge in Ladakh on 11th September, running 122 km and 72 km respectively in extreme low-oxygen conditions. 💪🏔️

To show our support and cheer them on, we’re organizing a Support Run Week from 8th to 14th September. You can participate by choosing one of the following distance categories and completing it over the week:

72 km – Khardung La Challenge
122 km – Silk Route Ultra
114 km – Khardung La + Ladakh Marathon
164 km – Silk Route Ultra + Ladakh Marathon
🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ You can split the distance across multiple runs throughout the week. All runs will be logged on Strava daily.

I understand it’s not a mileage week for many, especially with the Bangalore Marathon approaching. So feel free to team up with your running buddies to complete the distance together.

Let’s come together to support our heroes who’ve trained hard all year for this. Let’s keep the motivation high and the spirit stronger!

Please select your category and let’s make this week memorable! 🌟
